Light on when closed, light off when open.
------------------------------------------

If a door is closed, turn on the lights. If it is opened, turn them off.

This is a custom SmartThings app that I wrote to deal with my bathroom doors.

When you close the bathroom door it will automatically turn on the lights. If you open the door the lights turn off.

Now supports a "delay" when turning off the lights. "Allows a person to exit the room before turning them off"
