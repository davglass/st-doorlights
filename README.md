Light on when closed, light off when open.
------------------------------------------

If a door is closed, turn on the lights. If it is opened, turn them off.

This is a custom SmartThings app that I wrote to deal with my bathroom doors.

When you close the bathroom door it will automatically turn on the lights. If you open the door the lights turn off.
